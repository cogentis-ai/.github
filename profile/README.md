# Cogentis AI

Most GenAI projects fail to reach production not because models are weak, but because their answers cannot be trusted. Large language models are optimized to sound plausible, not to be correct, which makes them risky in regulated and mission-critical environments. We build AI systems where language models are not the source of knowledge or decisions, but an interface to structured, verifiable knowledge and formal reasoning. Every answer is explainable, traceable to sources, and auditable, and if a conclusion cannot be proven, the system does not produce it.
